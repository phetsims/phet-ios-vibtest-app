# phet-ios-vibtest-app

This app is to rapidly prototype and explore the feasibility of vibration feedback in a simulation on an iOS device.
We do not expect this app to ever be published. It is a playground to explore ideas. If this project continues to
seem promising, we will decide whether or not resultant vibration feedback can be built into simulations and the
dedicated PhET iOS App.
